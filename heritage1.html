            <h2>SIGIRIYA 169 KM (105 Miles) From Colombo</h2>
            <p>The Lion's Rock, commonly known as Sigiriya, is a rock castle and palace in Sri Lanka's Matale region. Gardens, ponds, and other constructions surround this ruin. King Kassapa erected Sigiriya, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sigiriya has Asia's best-preserved city center.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Previously, it was a Buddhist devotee-donated rock-shelter mountain monastery. It was later rebuilt by King Kassapa, who built gardens and a palace. It was used into a monastery after his death.The earliest human habitation in Sigiriya was discovered to be over five thousand years ago, during the Mesothilic era.<br><br>On many of the shelters, rock inscriptions near the drip ledges mark the giving of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as homes. Between the third century B.C. and the first century A.D., these were created.<br><br>The Sigiriya complex is made up of two rectangular precincts encircled by two moats and three walls, as well as the central rock. A square module serves as the foundation for the city.</p>

                <h2>Structure of The Lion Rock</h2>
                <p>The Sigiriya Rock is really a lava plug from an extinct volcano that has solidified. The Lion Staircase leading to the Palace Garden is the most notable feature of the rock. The Lion can be imagined as a massive creature looming over the rocky cliff. The Lion's gaping mouth leads to a brick and timber stairwell. The two paws and the brick walls that surround it are the only remnants of this magnificent building. The grooves and groves in the granite face, however, create the image of a lion.</p>
