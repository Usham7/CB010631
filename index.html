                <p>This chilly hill area of Sri Lanka was formerly a wilderness of forest and rainforest, nestled in the shadow of the 2524-meter-high peak Pidurutalagala, also known as Mount Pedro. In 1819, British colonial commander John Davy "found" the hill region and intended to create a sanatorium there.<br><br>Samuel Baker, an adventurer who also discovered Lake Albert in Uganda and investigated the Nile River, built Nuwara Eliya in 1846.<br><br>Nuwara Eliya, which translates to "City of Light," quickly became a popular cool-climate getaway for the British, as well as a "home away from home" where they could produce English vegetables and fruits like lettuce and strawberries. They began growing coffee here as well, but when the coffee plants succumbed to a disease, they turned to tea</p>
