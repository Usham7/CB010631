                <h2>THE WORLD'S END CLIFF & BAKER FALLS</h2>
                <p>Horton Plains National Park is the biggest plain in Sri Lanka's central highlands, with elevations ranging from 2100 to 2300 meters. It not only offers a lot of hiking and trekking opportunities, but it also features one of the top climbs in Sri Lanka. The hike to World's End Cliff is spectacular, forming a beautiful cirlce. It's a cliff with a drop of 4,000 feet (1200 meters) and a panoramic view over the provinces of Central and Sabaragamuwa. If you go, make sure you don't miss the magnificent Baker's Falls waterfall.<br><br>The nearest city to the national park, Nuwara Eliya,is 32 kilometers distant and is a fantastic site to start your journey and meet people to share a van with. A tuk-tuk ride from the city will set you back roughly $30.<br><br>This is a popular tourist trek because it loops in around two to three hours and isn't too difficult with fantastic rewards. It's worth mentioning that plastic bags are not permitted entry.</p>

                <h2>WHALE WATCHING</h2>
                <p>One of the most thrilling water activities you can enjoy while on vacation in Sri Lanka is whale and dolphin watching in Mirissa. Blue whales are the world's largest creatures, and Mirissa is the ideal destination in Sri Lanka for whale and dolphin watching cruises.<br><br>From November through April, the greatest months for whale viewing in Mirissa are March and April, with regular sightings of the whales. Because the waves are often quite turbulent in the afternoon, an early morning boat excursion, which normally begins at 6:00 AM or 7:00 AM, is advised. The whales are rarely observed during the off-season, which runs from May to October. At that time, the boat cruises are likewise infrequent.<br><br>Whale watching in Mirissa costs anything from LKR 5000 and LKR 10000, depending on the trip operator and the package they provide. The boat journeys usually take three to five hours, but they can run up to nine hours.</p>

                <h2>HOT AIR BALLOONING</h2>
                <p>Imagine gliding gently across Sri Lanka's breathtaking landscapes, which include gorgeous rivers, wonderful woods, verdant mountains, and old historical places. Hot air ballooning is a relatively young sport, but it is growing in popularity year after year. It's a one-of-a-kind way to see the nation, and no two routes are same, so you're sure to have a one-of-a-kind experience.<br><br>All of the balloons are made in the United Kingdom, and the pilots are also trained there. Throughout the flight, a trained ground team in a vehicle accompanies the air balloon to ensure that everything is in order.<br><br>Balloon rides are frequently planned early in the morning so that you may see the dawn from above. Early in the morning, about 6-7 a.m., depending on the season, takeoff begins. It's recommended to get a wakeup call from your hotel so that you can get up on time. Most hot air balloon trips are all-inclusive, and you'll be chauffeured to and from the departure location in an air-conditioned vehicle. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that shouldn't be passed up. A hot air balloon ride will set you back USD 220 per person.</p>
