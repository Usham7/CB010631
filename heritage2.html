            <h2>Anuradhapura Sacred City Sri Lanka</h2>
            <p>Anuradhapura is Sri Lanka's first capital, located in the north central region. It is one of Sri Lanka's historic capitals, and for many years, it was the epicenter of Theravada Buddhism. The Sacred City of Anuradhapura was designated as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1982 due to the remnants of an ancient Sri Lankan civilisation.</p>

                    <h2>History of Anuradhapura sacred city</h2>

                    <h2>Sri Lanka's Ancient Engineering Wonders</h2>
                    <p>The historic stupas and reservoirs are Anuradhapura's pride and joy. The ancient civil engineering wonders of Sri Lanka - towering stupas or dagobas (pagoda type buildings) with magnificent domes - were created taking into mind the effects of lighting on high-rise structures, among other technical variables. Magnificent rock carvings of monumental richness and remarkable grace, colossal stone pillars that stand proud amidst the ruins of royal palaces, Buddhist monasteries and temples, and magnificent stone cut swimming pools with sophisticated hydrology engineering techniques are among the other attractions at Anuradhapura.</p>
