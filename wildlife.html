                <div class="layer-text">
                    <p>Yala National Park, on Sri Lanka's south east coast, was designated as a protected area in 1938. It is a huge reserve with a diverse range of ecosystems, including open parkland and deep rainforest, as well as flooded lagoons and towering coastal sand dunes. This diverse landscape is home to a diverse diversity of plants and wildlife.<br><br>The world's biggest concentration of leopards is said to reside in Yala National Park. Although sightings of the elusive leopard are still rare, the average density of these gorgeous beasts is as high as one cat per square kilometer. Sambar and spotted deer, wild boar, crocodile, langur and toque monkeys, golden jackal, and even the sloth bear may be seen in Yala during the months of June and July when the palu tree bears fruit. There are approximately 200 kinds of birds documented here, and the reserve provides an ideal blend of freshwater, coastal, scrub, and forest regions for bird variety.</p>

                <div class="layer-text">
                    <p>Wilpattu is Sri Lanka's biggest national park, located in the country's arid lowlands in the north west. Wilpattu means 'natural lakes' in Sinhalese, and there are several shimmering lakes strewn around the area. Because of its low visitor numbers, this national park exudes a true feeling of wildness and authenticity; but, because wildlife is afraid of humans, sightings are less common than in more popular parks.<br><br>Nonetheless, a visit to Wilpattu National Park is a fantastic adventure, and the park's potential wildlife is among the best that Sri Lanka has to offer. Leopards stalk the bush, crocodiles swim in the park's many lakes, deer graze, and peafowl strut their stuff. Monitor lizards, tortoises, flycatchers, and jungle fowl are among the other intriguing animals that may be seen.</p>

                <div class="layer-text">
                    <p>Minneriya National Park is located in the north central province of Sri Lanka and is one of the country's smaller parks, covering slightly over 300 square miles. Despite its short size, the reserve has a diverse range of habitats, including grasslands and heavy scrub, dry tropical forest, and wetlands. During the dry months, Minneriya also has a man-made tank that filters water to the reservoir and nourishes the park's fauna.<br><br>Deer, purple-faced langur and macaque monkeys, sloth bears, and over 20 leopards have been spotted in Minneriya, as well as a diverse range of migratory and indigenous birds like as the hanging parrot, brown-capped babbler, and green bee-eater. During the dry season (July - October), however, the reserve's headline attraction is 'The Gathering,' a sight in which over 300 elephants assemble at the Minneriya reservoir in quest of water and new grass. This beautiful event is the world's largest gathering of Asian elephants.</p>
